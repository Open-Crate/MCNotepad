# Notepad

Notepad is a paper plugin allowing users to keep notes of anything they want all within Minecraft, stored in plain text files.

The main purpose for this is to allow users to conveniently store, share, edit and view lists without having to leave Minecraft

## Configuration
Information on configurating Notepad can be found at [the configuration documentation](/docs/configuration/README.md)

## Usage
Information on using notepad in-game can be found in game, with the extensive help action (/notepad help)

For an overview at what notepad can do without installing, here are the included actions presented in as smooth of a way as possible (may not be constantly up-to-date)
- Create `new` notes, `delete` existing notes and `list` your stored notes.
- `add` to notes, `removeline`s from notes, `insert` lines in the middle of notes and `move`/re-order entries in your notes. And of course, `view`ing your notes.
- For allowing players to share notes with those they trust, adding players to their `trust` list, `untrust`ing those they wish to remove from their trust list, ability to `listtrusted` users and `cleartrusted` users.
- For convenience with accessing other user's notes (when they have trusted you) users can use alts/altdirs, which to do so they must first `addalt`s and if they change their mind they can `removealt`s. Of course they can also `listalts` they have added.
- And checking the `version` from in-game, not that it brings a ton of use or anything. And if you really like checking the version of the plugin and typing `version` is a bit much, you can instead use `ver`.
